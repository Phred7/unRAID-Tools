root@Tower:~# pwmconfig
# pwmconfig version 3.6.0
This program will search your sensors for pulse width modulation (pwm)
controls, and test each one to see if it controls a fan on
your motherboard. Note that many motherboards do not have pwm
circuitry installed, even if your sensor chip supports pwm.

We will attempt to briefly stop each fan using the pwm controls.
The program will attempt to restore each fan to full speed
after testing. However, it is ** very important ** that you
physically verify that the fans have been to full speed
after the program has completed.

Found the following devices:
   hwmon0 is acpitz
   hwmon1 is nvme
   hwmon2 is nvme
   hwmon3 is coretemp
   hwmon4 is nct6798

Found the following PWM controls:
   hwmon4/pwm1           current value: 79
hwmon4/pwm1 is currently setup for automatic speed control.
In general, automatic mode is preferred over manual mode, as
it is more efficient and it reacts faster. Are you sure that
you want to setup this output for manual control? (n) y
   hwmon4/pwm2           current value: 79
hwmon4/pwm2 is currently setup for automatic speed control.
In general, automatic mode is preferred over manual mode, as
it is more efficient and it reacts faster. Are you sure that
you want to setup this output for manual control? (n) y
   hwmon4/pwm4           current value: 153
hwmon4/pwm4 is currently setup for automatic speed control.
In general, automatic mode is preferred over manual mode, as
it is more efficient and it reacts faster. Are you sure that
you want to setup this output for manual control? (n) y
   hwmon4/pwm5           current value: 153
hwmon4/pwm5 is currently setup for automatic speed control.
In general, automatic mode is preferred over manual mode, as
it is more efficient and it reacts faster. Are you sure that
you want to setup this output for manual control? (n) y
   hwmon4/pwm6           current value: 255
hwmon4/pwm6 is currently setup for automatic speed control.
In general, automatic mode is preferred over manual mode, as
it is more efficient and it reacts faster. Are you sure that
you want to setup this output for manual control? (n) y
   hwmon4/pwm7           current value: 255

Giving the fans some time to reach full speed...
Found the following fan sensors:
   hwmon4/fan1_input     current speed: 2960 RPM
   hwmon4/fan2_input     current speed: 2419 RPM
   hwmon4/fan3_input     current speed: 1620 RPM
   hwmon4/fan4_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
   hwmon4/fan5_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
   hwmon4/fan6_input     current speed: 1783 RPM
   hwmon4/fan7_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!

Warning!!! This program will stop your fans, one at a time,
for approximately 5 seconds each!!!
This may cause your processor temperature to rise!!!
If you do not want to do this hit control-C now!!!

Testing is complete.
Please verify that all fans have returned to their normal speed.

The fancontrol script can automatically respond to temperature changes
of your system by changing fanspeeds.
